# Time & Leave Tracker

Full-stack React/Vite and Express/PostgreSQL time and leave tracking application.

## Development

```bash
Copy-Item .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
npm install
npm run db:migrate
$env:ALLOW_DEV_SEED = "true"
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

The client runs on Vite and proxies `/api` to Express. Production uses `npm run build` followed by `npm start` with `NODE_ENV=production`.

Development credentials are configured through `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `SEED_HR_PASSWORD`, `SEED_USER_PASSWORD`, and `SEED_READONLY_PASSWORD` in `.env`. They are bcrypt-hashed before storage.

| Account              | Role                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| `admin@dev.local`    | Platform administrator |
| `hr@dev.local`       | HR manager |
| `manager@dev.local`  | Reporting manager    |
| `user@dev.local`     | Operational user     |
| `readonly@dev.local` | Read-only user       |

Passwords are read from the seed-password variables; development-only examples are in `.env.example`. Sessions use HttpOnly cookies and CSRF protection. The platform administrator must explicitly enter a tenant before accessing organization data. The client retains only a non-sensitive session-presence hint locally.

HR administrators can manage Departments and the Employee Directory, provision portal accounts, update reporting assignments, reset credentials without seeing passwords, export filtered audit CSV, and generate tenant-wide payroll-preparation summaries. Payroll exports include worked minutes, overtime, approved paid leave, and approved unpaid leave for the selected date range; they do not execute payroll.

Docker exposes development PostgreSQL on port `55432` and isolated test PostgreSQL on `55433`, avoiding conflicts with native Windows installations. Run `npm run db:test:prepare` after creating `.env` to prepare the integration database.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start client and server.
- `npm run db:migrate` — apply checksum-verified migrations.
- `npm run db:seed` — reset and seed the development database when `ALLOW_DEV_SEED=true`.
- `npm run test:all` — run the available automated checks.
- `npm run test:e2e` — run browser workflows with the development server running.
- `npm run verify:full` — run type checks, API tests, browser workflows, responsive checks, and accessibility audits.
- `npm run audit:security` — check cookie, CSRF, problem-response, and credential configuration.

File uploads remain metadata-only until a storage provider is selected.

Production startup fails closed unless database TLS, secure cookies, and independent JWT, CSRF, and cookie secrets are configured. Production secrets must contain at least 32 characters.

## Supabase and Vercel deployment

Vercel hosts the Vite application and the Express API on one origin. Supabase provides PostgreSQL only; authentication remains the application JWT/HttpOnly-cookie flow. Configure Vercel's Build Command as `npm run build` and Output Directory as `dist`. The `/api/*` rewrite is defined in `vercel.json`.

Use a Supabase Shared Pooler transaction URL for the Vercel runtime in `DATABASE_URL`, with `DB_SSL=true` and `DB_POOL_MAX=1`. Use a direct or session-pooler URL in `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` for `npm run db:migrate`; never run migrations in the Vercel build. Preview deployments must use a separate staging Supabase project. Production seeding is refused; use Docker or an explicitly permitted staging database for `npm run db:seed`.

See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for provisioning, environment variables, migrations, smoke tests, and rollback. Operational recovery and secret rotation are documented in [docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md).
